- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DudleyMike1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning, since it is never ending with software development
- The aim of this area is to save code for my students to use, this will be python, web development (html, css, js, php, sql).
- If you are looking for completed projects you are likely to be disappointed, the code will largely be partly built for students to work on.
- Another aim is to get my students used to using Git and Github when developing projects.
